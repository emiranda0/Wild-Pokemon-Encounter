# Wild-Pokemon-Encounter
For this project, I wanted to recreate encountering a wild Pokemon. To do this I thought of using the chatbot code as a foundation for the interactive user input and how it responds to some of the inputs. Since there are tons of different items (pokeballs, healing items, stat changers) and other components (Pokemon typing, being immune to certain moves) that can go into a Pokemon battle I decided to go with the basic components that make a Pokemon battle: The Pokemon's moveset (Fight), The ability to flee (Run), Check the Pokemon in your party (Pokemon), The amount of health (HP) each Pokemon has, and to have the opponent fight back. I did not allow the player to see the opponents HP because in a real encounter you can't see exactly how much HP the opponent has. If you win the battle your Pokemon will earn exp points to level up (although I have not implemented the level component this is just for effect) then the battle is over. If you lose you will blackout and lose some money and the battle is over.
